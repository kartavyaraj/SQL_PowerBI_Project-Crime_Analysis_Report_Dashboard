## Project Description

Crime analysis is essential for understanding public safety, identifying patterns, and supporting strategic decision-making. This project leverages SQL and Power BI to clean and pre-process crime data, analyze multiple metrics, and create a dynamic dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as crime trends by day, month, and hour, hotspots by city, crime types, victim demographics, weapon usage, and case closure rates.


## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize crime data, uncover patterns, and identify hotspots, enabling authorities and analysts to make data-driven decisions. The project leverages SQL and Power BI to transform raw data into actionable insights that enhance public safety and support effective decision-making and planning.


## Dataset Description

The Dataset used in this project is a CSV file contains detailed records of reported crimes and includes both original and derived columns to support comprehensive analysis and visualization. Key columns include:

- _report_number_: Unique identifier for each crime report.
- _date_reported / date_of_occurrence_: Dates when the crime was reported and when it occurred.
- _time_of_occurrence / hour_: Time and hour of the crime occurrence.
- _city_: Location where the crime took place.
- _crime_code / crime_description_: Classification and description of the crime.
- _victim_age / victim_age_group / victim_gender_: Demographic details of the victim.
- _weapon_used_: Weapon involved in the crime.
- _crime_domain_: Category or type of crime (e.g., theft, assault).
- _police_deployed_: Law enforcement units assigned to the case.
- _case_status / date_case_closed_: Status of the case and closure date.
- _year_: Year extracted from the date of occurrence for trend analysis.

This dataset combines raw data and derived columns such as victim_age_group and hour, enabling effective trend analysis, KPI computation, and interactive dashboard visualizations.

## Data Exploration & Analysis

The data exploration and analysis process was carried out in multiple steps to ensure accuracy and extract actionable insights from the crime dataset.

1. **Data Cleaning**
    - Initial cleaning was done using Power Query in Power BI.
    - Handled missing values, corrected data types, and standardized column names.

2. **Database Setup & Basic Analysis**
    - Imported the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL (pgAdmin) and created the main table.
    - Performed basic checks:
        - Counted rows to verify completeness.
        - Checked for missing values in critical columns.
        - Explored unique/distinct values for categorical columns like crime_code, city, and crime_description.

3. **Exploratory Insights Using SQL**
Some key insights extracted through SQL queries include:

    - _Crime Trends_: Analyzed total crimes by year, month, day of the week, and hour to identify peak crime periods.
    - _Crime Types_: Identified the most frequent crime categories and descriptions.
    - _Location Analysis_: Determined crime hotspots by city.
    - _Victim Demographics_: Studied distribution by age group and gender.
    - _Case Status & Police Deployment_: Explored open vs closed cases and resource allocation.
    - _Weapon Usage_: Found the most commonly used weapons in crimes.

These insights informed the creation of KPIs and interactive visualizations in the Power BI dashboard, providing a comprehensive view of crime patterns and trends.

## Key Insights

Between **January 2020 and July 2024**, a total of **40,160 crime** cases were reported across India. The analysis uncovers geographical hotspots, demographic patterns, weapon usage, and temporal crime behavior, providing a holistic view of the crime landscape.

- ***Case Status & Resolution***

    - Cases were almost evenly split between **open (~50%)** and **closed (~50%)**.

    - The average case closure duration was **88 days**, though this varied significantly across cities.

    - Some cities demonstrated efficient closure processes, resolving cases within weeks, while others lagged, leaving a high backlog of open cases.

- ***Geographical Crime Distribution***

    - **Delhi** consistently emerged as **India’s crime capital**, with **5,400+ reported cases**, far surpassing other cities.

    - Major metros like **Pune and Surat** also recorded higher crime rates, particularly **violent and weapon-related crimes**.

    - Smaller cities such as **Rajkot, Faridabad, and Varanasi** reported significantly fewer cases, indicating either **lower crime** prevalence or underreporting.

    - Urban centers showed higher incidents of **fraud, burglary, and domestic violence**, while smaller towns leaned towards **property damage and localized disputes**.  

- ***Demographics of Victims***
    - Women were the most frequent victims, accounting for **22,423 cases (55.8%)**.

    - Age Group 19–40: Dominated by **burglary and fraud**-related crimes.

    - Age Group 41–60: More exposed to **homicide, fraud, and firearm offenses**.

    - Age Group 60+: Faced high levels of **vandalism and property-related crimes**.

    - Gender and age analysis reveals that young to middle-aged women are the most vulnerable demographic segment.

- ***Weapons in Crime***
    - **71.4%** of all crimes **involved weapons**, underscoring the seriousness of incidents.

    - **Knives** were the most commonly used weapon, frequently linked to **burglary and domestic violence** cases.

    - **Firearm**-heavy cities included **Delhi, Pune, and Surat**, reflecting urban gang activity and organized crime.

    - Non-lethal weapons **(rods, blunt objects)** were more common in **vandalism and street disputes**.

- ***Temporal Analysis – When Crimes Happen***

    - Peak crime hour: **11 AM**, often associated with ***fraud, theft, and daytime domestic disputes***.

    - Peak crime day: **Wednesdays**, possibly linked to mid-week activity spikes.

    - Peak crime month: **March**, across multiple years, suggesting seasonal or socio-economic triggers.

    - Daytime crimes: **Fraud, homicide, and domestic violence** were more prevalent.

    - Nighttime crimes: **Burglary, vandalism, and firearm offenses** dominated.  

- ***Crime Trends Over the Years***

    - **2021** recorded the **highest crime volume**, possibly linked to post-pandemic socio-economic stress.

    - After 2021, some categories **(like fraud) declined**, while violent crimes **(firearm offenses, homicide) maintained** steady rates.

    - Top recurring crimes across all years:
        - Burglary 
        - Vandalism 
        - Fraud 
        - Domestic Violence 
        - Firearm Offenses 



#### Key Takeaways & Suggestions

1. Delhi remains the crime hotspot → Increase patrolling, CCTV coverage, and rapid response in high-risk zones.

2. Peak crime hours (11AM, 5PM, 9AM, 4AM, 3AM) → Align police shifts and patrols with high-risk timings.

3. Mid-week crimes (Wednesdays highest) → Launch awareness drives and community policing initiatives.

4. Women & age group 19–40 most vulnerable → Prioritize safety programs, emergency helplines, and self-defense initiatives.

5. Allocate police resources, surveillance, and outreach to high-crime cities and at-risk demographics
6. High firearm usage cities (Delhi, Pune, Surat, Rajkot) → Enforce strict weapon checks, audits, and firearm policing.

7. Case closure efficiency varies → Adopt best practices from fast cities (Varanasi, Faridabad, Kanpur) and improve processes in slow cities (Vasai, Ludhiana, Meerut).

8. Top crimes: Burglary, Vandalism, Fraud → Implement neighborhood watch programs, fraud alerts, and smart lock technologies.

9. Violent crimes & firearm offenses → Require stricter law enforcement, conflict resolution workshops, and special task forces.

10. Day vs. Night patterns → Adjust deployment: daytime (fraud, domestic violence), nighttime (burglary, vandalism, firearm offenses).
